It was February 12, 2017 and I was driving my car on an interstate in Phoenix, Arizona. The sun was beating down on my car roof, yet the temperature was bearable, if only because of the car's AC unit. The radio, turned to a low volume, was playing ads in the background. One of my sisters, Heather, was seated in the passenger seat of my car. My other sister, Tiffany, was driving her car about a car's length ahead of us, leading the way. My hands gripped the steering wheel anxiously. The day was finally here.

For a few weeks now, Tiffany had hinted at her intent to foster a few puppies from Arizona Cattle Dog Rescue ([ACDR](https://arizonacattledogrescue.org/)). The organization specializes in rescuing disadvantaged Australian Cattle Dogs from around Arizona, keeping them healthy (or nursing them back to health if need be), then matching them with responsible pet owners who will love and take care of them for life. Tiffany had helped the organization many times before, but this time asked if Heather and I wanted to help her foster puppies. The plan was to each get one puppy that we would be responsible for until the time came that they were adopted. It seemed easy enough. I agreed to help, reminding myself that this would only be temporary.

After meandering through a few neighborhoods in search of the ACDR representative's house, we pulled up to a well kempt corner house with cactus, trees, and rocks adorning the yard. As my car's brakes hissed and brought us to a stop, I saw a black SUV approaching in my rear-view mirror. "That must be her," I thought. The black SUV came around the corner and pulled up to the house, stopping parallel to the curb. My sisters and I got out of our cars. Randi, the ACDR representative, warmly greeted us as she popped open the rear of her car. Inside were two dog crates. One crate contained a grown Australian Cattle Dog with beautiful black and white markings, and the other was chock-full of puppies. The puppies were varied in temperament. Some were excitedly crawling over others to get a closer look at the strange faces peering in and others, more reserved, were content to lay quietly in the corner.

We were informed that these puppies had been rescued from a hoarder situation. Some guy had been letting his dogs run rampant on his property and a few of them had litters. The pups had fleas, gunky eyes, possible unknown health problems, and dusty and poop covered coats. The puppies had been cleaned, given their first DHPP vaccination, and dipped in a flea bath earlier that day, but you could still tell they were in bad shape from the hoarder's house from the red, gunky eyes, bloated bellies, and overall lack of energy.

My sisters and I peered over the pile of puppies and began thinking of which one we would each like to foster. The puppies were all so adorable and friendly that it was hard to choose. A small-statured female pup was glimpsing at us from the center of the cage. "Definitely that one," I thought. I reached out to pet her, but she seemed unenthused (to say the least). She froze up, looked around with large, pleading eyes, and moved away from my hands. "Well then..." I thought. Just as the female pup was sulking away, a playful male puppy pounced forwards, clawing his way over his fellow crate-mates, and licked my hand. This puppy had a black double-masked face and a black spot at the base of his tail. I picked him up to see how he'd react, fearing he might copy the actions of his sister. To my pleasant surprise, he didn't. He licked my hands, arms, and face, and grinned at me before falling asleep in my arms. _This was the one._

Tiffany decided on the shy female that ran away from me earlier and Heather ended up getting two puppies, both white with black face markings. To celebrate the event, we decided to take the pups to a nearby park. At first the puppies didn't know why the floor was rumbling beneath them, but seemed to quickly acclimate to the car.

The park breathed a newfound energy into the pups. Enamored at all the strange sights and sounds, the puppies began chasing me around and trying to wander off from time to time to chase the ducks at the nearby pond. Harnessing their herding instincts, the puppies also decided to chase after shoelaces.

Tiffany ended up naming the shy girl **Pip**. Heather named the black half-masked pup **Maggie** and the black double-masked pup **Mae**.

We arrived home later that night and a slew of names flowed through my brain, but eventually I ended on a space related one: **Astro**(nomy). Astro, seemingly contented with his new home and name, fell asleep in my lap while I was doing computer work.
